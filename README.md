# Stackoverflow-Job-Openings-and-Labor-Turnover-Survey
This is a project my colleagues and I worked on together investigating job openings based on Stackoverflow and job openings dataset. Stackoverflow is a community for developers looking to discuss tech related topics and Jolts is a Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey that provides information and job openings around the US.
