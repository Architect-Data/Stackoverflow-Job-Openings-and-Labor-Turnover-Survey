# Stackoverflow-Job-Openings-and-Labor-Turnover-Survey
This is a project my colleagues and I worked on in our graduate school investigating job openings based on Stackoverflow and job openings dataset. We used the dataset to provide insights to a client company based in Seattle. Stackoverflow is a community for developers looking to discuss tech related topics and Jolts is a Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey that provides information and job openings around the US. Using the two datasets, my colleagues and I discovered patterns and provided business solutions to the client.
